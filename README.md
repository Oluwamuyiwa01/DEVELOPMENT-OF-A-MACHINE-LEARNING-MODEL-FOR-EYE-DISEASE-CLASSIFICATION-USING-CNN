# DEVELOPMENT-OF-A-MACHINE-LEARNING-MODEL-FOR-EYE-DISEASE-CLASSIFICATION-USING-CNN
This model is designed to accurately detect and classify three eye diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), with a web interface for image upload, diagnosis, and result interpretation.
## Overview.  
The Eye Disease Image Classification System is a deep learning-based diagnostic tool developed to automatically detect and classify various eye conditions from retinal fundus images. Powered by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the system is trained on a diverse dataset that includes diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and normal cases.
To enhance accuracy and generalization while minimizing computational cost, the model incorporates data augmentation techniques. Designed for real-time usage and deployed via Flask, the system is lightweight and optimized to run on standard hardware, making it suitable for low-resource clinical environments.
This project supports early disease detection, improves diagnostic confidence, and contributes to accessible and interpretable AI-powered medical imaging.
