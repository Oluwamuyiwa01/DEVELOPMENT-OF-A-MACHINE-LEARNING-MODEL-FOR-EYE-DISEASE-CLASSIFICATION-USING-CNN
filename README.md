# DEVELOPMENT-OF-A-MACHINE-LEARNING-MODEL-FOR-EYE-DISEASE-CLASSIFICATION-USING-CNN
This model is designed to accurately detect and classify three eye diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), with a web interface for image upload, diagnosis, and result interpretation.
## Overview.  
This project implements a scalable and reliable eye disease image classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The system integrates a Flask-based backend and a user-friendly frontend to enable image upload, and automated classification. It supports early detection of ocular diseases by providing accurate results and enhancing diagnostic accessibility. The system has been rigorously tested to ensure high performance and usability, making it suitable for practical deployment in real-world settings.
